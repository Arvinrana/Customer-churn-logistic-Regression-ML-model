Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

This project analyzes customer churn data to identify the key factors driving customer retention and attrition. It combines data preprocessing, machine learning modeling, and Power BI visualization to deliver actionable business insights.

🔍 Project Overview

Goal: Understand why customers leave (churn) and predict which customers are likely to churn next.

Dataset: 10,000+ customer records containing demographics, account details, and churn status.

Tech Stack: Python, Power BI, SQL, Excel

ML Model: Gradient Boosting Classifier (trained & tuned for churn prediction)

⚙️ Key Features

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing data, encoded categorical features, and scaled numerical variables.

Exploratory Analysis: Examined churn patterns by geography, gender, tenure, product count, and balance.

Machine Learning Model: Built and evaluated a Gradient Boosting Classifier to predict churn probability.
